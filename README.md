# imbibe

> **im·bibe** /imˈbīb/ (verb): To absorb or assimilate ideas or knowledge.

Welcome to **imbibe**. This repository is a dedicated space where I document my journey as I learn various concepts in Computer Science, from the logic of algorithms to the nuances of machine learning.

## Learning in Public

I’m a firm believer in the **Build/Learn in Public** thing. This repo isn't meant to be a polished textbook; it’s a raw, evolving record of my growth.
Having this public repo will keep me consistent.
If my notes or mini-projects help even one person understand a concept better, this repo has done its job.

## What’s Inside?

I’ve organized my learning into specific domains. Each section contains my personal notes, resources, and code implementations.
(May it be an ever-growing list)

| Module | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DSA** | Data Structures & Algorithms implementations and LeetCode patterns. | ⚪ Planned |
| **DBMS** | Database management, SQL deep dives, and schema design notes. | 🟡 In Progress |
| **ML** | Mathematics, Scikit-learn, and building models from scratch. | 🟡 In Progress |
| **Projects** | Mini-applications that bridge the gap between theory and practice. | ⚪ Planned |
